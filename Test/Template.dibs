# Dibs templating syntax
# Comments follow PowerShell commenting syntax
# Comments begin with the octothorpe (#)
    # and indents don't matter
# Block comments begin with <# and end with #>
<#
There are two types of variables for templating
- Page variables
- Shell variables


Page variables can be declared at the top (and only at the top) 
of the page with |_ var = value _|
    - Output with |_ var _| 
    - Spacing does not matter i.e.
        - |_var_|       <-- Valid
        - |_ var _|     <-- Valid
        - |_   var   _| <-- Valid
        - |_ var _      <-- Invalid (missing ending | character)
    - Page variables are local to the page and are nonexistent once the page
      has completed processing
Shell variables are set via external processing in PowerShell
    - A dollar sign ($) marks a shell variable 
    - Output with |_ $shellVar _| 
    - Shell variables cannot be set on a page
#>
|_pageTitle = "My Page"_|

#
html # comments can trail
    head
        # To output variables, wrap in |_  _|
        #Page variables 
        title |_ pageTitle " - " $siteTitle _|

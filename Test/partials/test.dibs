<#
    This is a partial. Partials contain portions of 
    a larger HTML page often used for repetition or 
    to segment layers of a page

    Partials adhere to the variable construct laid 
    out in the template file. Partial variables (or 
    page variables) are still declared only at the top
    of the partial file. Shell variables remain the
    same.

    The biggest difference between a page and a
    partial is that a partial does not/will not get
    a doctype added. An added doctype will be ignored
    nor will one be generated since it is part of a larger 
    page that already has a doctype defined.

    A single variable can be passed to a partial
